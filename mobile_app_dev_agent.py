    handoff_description="The Mobile App Development Agent is designed to directly process and respond to queries related to mobile app development, covering platforms like iOS (Swift, Objective-C, Xcode), Android (Kotlin, Java, Android Studio), cross-platform frameworks (e.g., Flutter, React Native, Xamarin), app design, UI/UX, mobile APIs, app testing, debugging, app store deployment, and other mobile app-related technologies or tools. Unlike a triage agent, this agent does not route queries to other sub-agents; instead, it handles all relevant queries itself, providing comprehensive and actionable responses. If a query falls outside the scope of mobile app development, the agent responds with a polite note indicating the query is out of scope."
